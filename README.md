# 🏪 Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-Capstone-Project

## 📌 Problem Statement

A retail chain with multiple outlets across the country is facing challenges in managing inventory to effectively match demand and supply.
This project focuses on using data-driven techniques to predict future sales and assist Walmart in optimizing inventory and operational decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to forecast store sales for the next 12 weeks using machine learning techniques.
By analyzing time-based data, holiday effects, fuel prices, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI), this project aims to assess how temporal and external factors influence Walmart’s sales performance.

## 🧾 Data Description

The dataset includes historical weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, with features such as:

Store locations

Weekly sales data

Special events and holidays

CPI (Consumer Price Index)

Fuel prices

This dataset helps uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that affect sales, allowing Walmart to plan inventory more efficiently and reduce stockouts.

## ⚙️ Algorithm and Motivation

The selection of algorithms depends on the type of forecasting problem.
Since this is a time-series forecasting problem, the project explores machine learning and statistical models that capture temporal trends, seasonality, and the impact of external variables.

## 🧠 Assumptions

Accurate forecasting requires sufficient and relevant historical data.
Missing factors like demographics or local store conditions may reduce prediction accuracy.
The available dataset provides limited context for fully capturing real-world dynamics.

## 📊 Model Evaluation and Techniques

The project applies time-series forecasting models using historical sales data for each store.
Techniques include:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering,

Training models on store-level data,

Evaluating results through visualization of training vs. test data and confidence intervals,

These techniques help capture seasonality, trends, and random variations influencing sales.

## 📈 Inferences

Machine learning enables pattern recognition and trend detection from historical sales data.
Predictive analytics enhances accuracy by identifying factors such as holidays, weather, and seasonality.
Insights can be applied to inventory optimization, marketing planning, and demand management.

## 🚀 Future Scope

Potential extensions include:

Implementing models like Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Time Series Models such as SARIMA, SARIMAX, or Auto-ARIMA.
Incorporating external datasets (customer demographics, regional events, promotions).
Deploying a dashboard or web app to visualize real-time sales forecasts for each store.

## 📊 Visualization

Visual analysis includes:
Graphs comparing training data, actual test data, and forecasts. Confidence intervals for visualizing model reliability and accuracy.
